## Upgrading from 3.4.0 to 4.0.0

The new SearchBundle is now based on our [PHP Client v2](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/php/). In addition to providing you with all the new features our PHP Client v2 has to offer, it has been redesigned to give the most intuitive and easy-to-use experience. 
For that reason, we tried to make the architecture as clear as possible and we got rid of the Search Engine-agnostic feature. As an example, `AlgoliaEngine` and `IndexManager` classes have been merge into one single `SearchService` class.
Also, the Algolia Client is now public. Its methods signatures and return types have however changed from v1 to v2. Please read carefully our [PHP Client v2 upgrade guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/upgrade-guides/php/) to get a list of thoses changes.

We attempt to document every possible breaking change. Since some of these breaking changes are in obscure parts of the API Client, only a portion of these changes may affect your application.

Upgrade your `algolia/search-bundle` dependency from `3.4` to `^4.0` in your `composer.json` file and run `composer update algolia/search-bundle` in your terminal.


## Miscellaneous

We strongly encourage you to take a look at the [PHP Client v2 upgrade guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/upgrade-guides/php/) to get acquainted with the new features deployed in this version.


## Features âœ¨
* Better DX with the usage of our PHP Client v2 (entire redesign transparent to end user to make it faster and easier to use, lots of new methods among which `copyIndex`, `replaceAllObjects`, better Exceptions, ...)
* All the methods from the `SearchService` are *waitable*. You can wait for the engine to finish its task before moving on to a new one. See [`->wait()`](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/wait-task/) method for more info.
* Refactoring and simplification of the bundle with the merge of the two classes `AlgoliaEngine` and `IndexManager` to one `SearchService`. The bundle is now clearer and easier to browse.
* Better doc blocks to improve the public API and auto-completion.
* The possibility to additional arguments and options thanks to the `$requestOptions` argument, available in all `SearchService` methods.
* Algolia Client is now public by default. You can make direct calls to it every time you need to perform advanced operations (like managing API keys, indices and such).

</div>

Moreover, the `search.client` service is now public.

## SearchService

`IndexManager` has been renamed to `SearchService`. This is the only service you will need to interact with Algolia.
However, to avoid direct calls to the API during your tests, we created the `SearchServiceInterface`. Please use it only
for testing purposes, as this interface is targeted for changes in minor versions.

Previously, to get started:

```php
namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Algolia\SearchBundle\IndexManagerInterface;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{

    protected $indexManager;

    public function __construct(IndexManagerInterface $indexingManager)
    {
        $this->indexManager = $indexingManager;
    }
}
```

Now, in the `4.0.0` you should update your code to:

```php
namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use Algolia\SearchBundle\SearchServiceInterface;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{

    protected $searchService;

    public function __construct(SearchServiceInterface $searchService)
    {
        $this->searchService = $searchService;
    }
}
```

Most of the methods now return Algolia `AbstractResponse`. That means you can take advantage of the [`->wait()`](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/wait-task/) method 
to wait for your tasks to be completely handled by Algolia Engine before moving on.

To have the most consistent, predictable, and future-proof method signature, we followed three rules:

- All required parameters have a single argument each
- All optional arguments are passed in an array (or RequestOptions object), as the last argument, and is called `$requestOptions`
- The client never sets any default values

Here are a few examples:


```php
# v3
$result = $this->indexManager->remove(
    $searchablePosts,
    $this->get('doctrine')->getManager(),
    // you could not pass requestOptions
);

# v4
$result = $this->searchService->remove(
    $searchablePosts,
    $this->get('doctrine')->getManager(),
    // here you can pass any requestOptions, for example 'X-Forwarded-For', 'Algolia-User-Id'...
    [
        'X-Forwarded-For' => '0.0.0.0',
    ]
);
```

```php
# v3
$result = $this->indexManager->search(
    'foo', 
    Post::class, 
    $this->get('doctrine')->getManager(),
    // the optional page and hitsPerPage parameters were passed separately
    1,
    20,
    'attributesToRetrieve' => [
        'title',
    ],
);

# v4
$result = $this->searchService->search(
    'foo', 
    Post::class, 
    $this->get('doctrine')->getManager(),
    // all the optional parameters are now sent as once in the $requestOptions
    [
        'page'                 => 0,
        'hitsPerPage'          => 20,
        'attributesToRetrieve' => [
            'title',
        ],
    ]
);
```
